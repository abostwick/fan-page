    <h2>What is Overwatch?</h2>
    <p>Overwatch is a First Person shooter done in a MOBA style, where you select heros with different abilities that accomplish different agendas. It's a game that breaks away from the modern military shooter genre where it had t worry about realism and what the real weapons and feel of real world war felt like. With Overwatch, you get a fun, colorfull shooter that can do or try anything it puts its mind to, and with all the different heros and abilities, it's like a mash up of many genres into one game.</p>
    <h2>Roles in Overwatch</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Offense, which have the highest DPS (damage per second) out of all the heros, but have low health.</li>
        <li>Defense, which are capable of fortifying positions to stop enemy advances.</li>
        <li>Tank, where you are practically a bullet sponge that can break through enemy lines and defenses.</li>
        <li>Support, such as healing, buffs, debuffs, and revives.</li>
    </ul>
